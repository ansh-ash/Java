/**Design a class named ShowRoom with the following description:

Instance variables/data members:

String name: to store the name of the customer.
long mobno: to store the mobile number of the customer.
double cost: to store the cost of the items purchased.
double dis: to store the discount amount.
double amount: to store the amount to be paid after discount.

Member methods:

ShowRoom(): default constructor to initialize data members.
void input(): to input customer name, mobile number, cost.
void calculate(): to calculate discount on the cost of purchased items, based on the following criteria:

COST                                                      DISCOUNT (IN PERCENTAGE)

Less than or equal to Rs. 10000                           5%
More than Rs. 10000 and less than or equal to Rs. 20000   10%
More than Rs. 20000 and less than or equal to Rs. 35000   15%
More than Rs. 35000                                       20%

void display(): to display customer name, mobile number, amount to be paid after discount.
Write a main() method to create an object of the class and call the above member methods.
